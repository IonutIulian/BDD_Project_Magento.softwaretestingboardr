Magento BDD Automation Framework

Site tested: magento.softwaretestingboard

Design pattern used: page object model

Methodology: behavior driven development

This project was done at the end of the course for the final exam.
I chose to test the functionality of an e-commerce website.
The website I chose is called :https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/
I chose a demo site because I wanted to test the creation of a user account without having to use a valid email address, 
placing an order to the last step and placing a review.Activities that could not be done without a user account.
My project was based on a BDD (Behavior Driven Development) software development approach because it was based on test scenarios that reflected my functional expectations for the application and which I implemented using the Behave library.
The scenarios and automated test mapping were written in the Gherkin language and the software development methodology I used was waterfall
